🔄 Pull Request Workflow Update

We have introduced multiple Pull Request (PR) templates for this repository to improve code review quality and ensure that all required details are provided when raising a PR.

📌 What Changed

Added a .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ folder in the repo.

Created two separate PR templates:

frontend_pr.md → For UI/UX or client-side changes.

backend_pr.md → For API, database, or server-side changes.

🚀 How It Works

When you create a new Pull Request, GitHub will now show a “Choose a template” dropdown.

You can pick the correct template based on your work:

Frontend PR Template → For UI changes, styling, components, etc.

Backend PR Template → For API, DB schema, server logic, etc.

Fill in the required details before submitting for review.

✅ Action for Team

Always select the correct PR template when creating a PR.

Ensure ClickUp task links and Acceptance Criteria are completed.

This update will help us test how GitHub shows the dropdown template selection on new PRs.
